# Chocolate-reviews-Exploratory-Analysis-and-Visualization
This project explores and analyses data on Chocolate reviewed in a specific time frame. This data set appears to have a time period between 2006 and 2021.
The number of ingredients range from 1 to 6, the average rating of a chocolate bar is 3.2, and the average cocoa percent is roughly 71.5.
Amongst the 2530 bars reviewed, Venezuela, Peru, Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Madagascar had the highest number of bars under review.
This data does not show any clear relationship between percentage of cocoa in a bar and the rating of a bar, other factors might have an influence on rating.
Bars without Lecitihin on average are rated higher than bars with Lecithin, this could be related to the widely held belief that Lecithin is often used as a 'mask' for poor quality Chocolate bars, although there is a negative correlation between the percent of cocoa in a bar and what that bar is rated, so ratings might be based on factors other than cocoa content/ ingredient content.
The pairplot does not show any obvious relationship between the origin and quality(which was determined by rating, num_of_ingredients and cocoa percent) and so it is concluded that there is no obvious relationship between Bean Origin and Quality.
